# openhb_mqtt_esp8266

This is a series of Arduino code I have been working on, the code has modular blocks and I am working on removing any configuration data from the code itself. All configuration data (user credentials, wifi details etc) should be stored in a file called env_vars.h in the source directory. I use PlatformIO instead of the Arduino IDE. The code is written for NodeMCU ESP8266 and works with MQTT and OpenHAB. I will include OpenHAB examples soon.
